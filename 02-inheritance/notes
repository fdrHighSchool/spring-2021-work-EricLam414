A class can only inherit from one parent class using extends

Inheritance allows you to reuse data and behavior from the parent class.

An inheritance either have a has-a or an is-a relationship

Subclasses cannot access the private instance variables in the parent class and constructors are not inherited

Using super() can initalize instance variables by calling the constructor

You can override an inherited method by having a method in the child class with the same method signature

Getters and setters can be used to access instance variables

You can use super.method() to force the parentâ€™s method to be called.

A super class variable can hold an object of its child classes

An arrayList can be created using the superclass type and hold subclass types.
